With none to be found nearby, Jim and Scott had two choices: road trip to New York, or open a wing joint close to home. Lucky for us, they chose the latter. Hence, the beginning of Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck, now Buffalo Wild Wings®, the welcoming neighborhood atmosphere with a front-row seat for every sports fan that offers 26 mouth-watering signature sauces and seasonings",
