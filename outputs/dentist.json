With a workday that ends with the school day and no nights or weekends, our program is perfect for dentists looking to supplement their current income, working parents, recent graduates, those looking towards retirement and anyone who wants to make a difference in the dental field.\n\nWe are currently looking for dentists in Kalamazoo, MI and the surrounding areas.\n\nDentist Qualifications:\n• DMD or DDS degree\n• Ability to work well with both children & adults\n• Valid driver’s license, reliable transportation and willingness to travel daily to/from school site\n\nMichigan Dental Outreach Offers:\n• Evenings, weekends and summers off!\n• Working a school day schedule (about 6 – 7 hours); on average between 8:00 A.M. – 3:00 P.M.\n• Benefit package (health, dental, vision)\n• Unique work experience and flexible scheduling\n• Full and part time positions\n• Competitive compensation\n• State-of-the-art portable dental equipment\n• Latest technology & digital radiography\n\nWant to learn more? Call or text Venice at 855-957-4375 or email vjabiru@mobiledentists.com\n\n(If texting/emailing, please include your name, contact information and the location of this position.)\n\nKnow a dentist who may be interested?\n\nEARN UP TO $6,000 for a referral.\n\nCall or text Venice at 855-957-4375 or email vjabiru@mobiledentists.com\n\nWho We Are\n\nSmile America Partners is the nation's leading in-school dental program founded almost two decades ago by two moms, who happen to also be dentists. The founders saw a tremendous need among underserved school aged children who did not have easy access to dental care and who often suffered from poor oral hygiene, tooth decay, pain and associated medical problems. Knowing that many parents could not take their children to the dentist due to issues including time off from work and transportation challenges, they sought to bring the care to the need. Today, through its dental partners, Smile America Partners provides preventive and restorative care to approximately 500,000 children per year.\n\nTooth decay is the most common, and preventable disease among children, more common than asthma. In fact, each year, over 51 million school hours are lost due to oral health related issues.\n\nSmile America Partners affiliates with state licensed dentists, hygienists and assistants who use state-of-the-art portable equipment to provide all services onsite, directly in the school or in a self-contained mobile dental facility on site at the school. If portable equipment is used, classrooms, auditoriums or other school venues are literally transformed into fully functional dental offices for the day. Our expertise, obtained through years of experience bringing mobile dental care to schools, as well as through our highly qualified staff, enables us to bring exceptional care with minimal disruption to the normal school routine.\n\nSmile America Partners is currently active in 20 states and has ongoing strategic partnerships with over 8,000 school districts, including 21 of the 25 largest school districts in the country.\n\nGiven the ongoing lack of access for many underserved children across the country, our services are in great demand and we are always looking for caring, compassionate professionals to join our team and play their part in making a difference in the lives of today's underserved children.\n\nRewarding Work. Competitive Compensation. Smile America Partners.\n\nSmile America Partners is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation or protected veteran status",
