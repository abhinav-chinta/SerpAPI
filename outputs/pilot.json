Below are some examples of the vast opportunities in this field...\n\nAVIATION JOBS IN THE NAVY\n\nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER\n\nCommercial airlines aren’t the only ones who need traffic management. In the Navy, our fighter jets, helicopters and reconnaissance aircraft need vigilant Air Traffic Controllers to keep flight decks and airstrips in check.\n\nAIRCREWMAN MECHANICAL\n\nAs in-flight personnel, AWFs maintain and troubleshoot aircraft while carefully handling million-dollar equipment on board. Perform everything from medical evacuations to small arms transports to delivering necessities to your fellow Sailors out at sea.\n\nAIRCREWMAN OPERATOR\n\nPlaying mind games with your opponent to predict their every move may sound like the plot of a movie, but in reality AWOs are the ultimate defense against the threats from the deep, locating, tracking and engaging hostile submarines.\n\nAVIATION ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN\n\nOnce an aircraft launches off a carrier, pilots depend on their jet’s complex electronic systems to operate all areas of their craft and complete their mission. There is zero room for failure.\n\nPAY AND BENEFITS\n\nFrom the day you start, you’ll receive:\n• Competitive salary\n• Potential to earn a bonus upon enlistment\n• Free health insurance\n• Free housing\n• A retirement plan\n• Paid training\n\nEDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES\n• Undergraduate degree opportunities\n• Navy College Program and Tuition Assistance\n• Post-9/11 GI Bill, up to 100% tuition\n• Professional credentials and certifications\n• College credit hours toward a bachelor’s or associate degree through the American Council on Education\n\nQUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS\n• U.S. citizen or equivalent\n• High school graduate or equivalent\n• 17 years of age or older\n\nWORK ENVIRONMENT\n\nMake the world your home. You may be assigned to sea or shore squadrons on almost any continent. You will have the opportunity to work in a variety of environments—from airborne aircraft to hangars, hangar decks to flight decks and flight lines at air stations and on aircraft carriers.\n\nPART-TIME OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThere are part-time opportunities in Air Support for the Navy. Serving part-time as a Navy Reserve Sailor, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Sailors in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes",

    "description": "ABOUT\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates more than 3,700 aircraft, making it the second largest air force in the world — second only to the U.S. Air Force. Below are the careers in aviation that work together to get our birds in the sky...\n\nAVIATION JOBS IN THE NAVY\n\nFIGHTER PILOT - Complete complex air maneuvers while flying at Mach speeds. Catapult off carriers at 170 mph and land on moving runways only 300 feet long. Gather intel, drop ordnance and conduct defensive missions—all in the F/A-18 Hornet and the cutting-edge F-35C Lightning II.\n\nAIRCRAFT HANDLING OFFICER - Every performance needs a choreographer and on the deck of an aircraft carrier, that person is you. You’re in charge of directing the movement of the entire flight deck from the jet launch sequence to aircraft recovery.\n\nFIXED WING PILOT - In the C-2 Greyhound, you transport parts, personnel, and mail to the 5,000 people aboard. In the cockpit of the E-2C Hawkeye, you’re on patrol as the command control center in the sky. If you’re flying the P-3 Orion or the brand-new P-8 Poseidon, you hunt submarines using cutting- edge software, radar, sonar, and acoustics.\n\nHELICOPTER PILOT - As a helicopter pilot, the sky is your domain. Hover over the sea for search and rescue, extract Sailors and Special Forces from a hot landing zone or track and neutralize enemy submarines in defense of your ship.\n\nNAVAL FLIGHT OFFICER - In this role, you’re the navigator, the lookout and the weapon operator inside naval aviation. Whether you’re hunting submarines from a P-8 Poseidon, navigating an E-2 Hawkeye through enemy territory or dropping bombs from the backseat of an F-18 fighter jet.\n\nAVIATION MAINTENANCE DUTY OFFICER - You’re in charge of managing the repair and upkeep of our most lethal aviation assets—over eighty different types of aircraft. In addition to that, you manage hundreds of personnel, making this a job that requires a level of organization and focus that few can say they’ve mastered.\n\nPAY AND BENEFITS\n\nFrom the day you start, you’ll receive:\n• Competitive salary\n• Free health insurance\n• Free housing\n• A retirement plan\n• 30 days paid vacation per year\n\nEDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES\n\nBeyond professional credentials and certifications, the Navy can help ease your financial burdens and advance your career with generous financial assistance and continuing education programs, including:\n• Post-9/11 GI Bill\n• Navy Tuition Assistance Program\n• Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)\n• Navy College Program\n• VOLED Assistance Center\n• VOLED Region Advisors\n• Navy War College (NWC)\n• USAF Air University Air Command and Staff College\n\nQUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS\n• Bachelor’s degree\n• Students may apply in last 12 months of pursuing degree\n• U.S. citizen or equivalent\n• 17 years of age or older\n\nGeneral qualifications may vary depending upon whether you’re currently serving, whether you’ve served before or whether you’ve never served before.\n\nWORK ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn the field of aviation, you’ll make the world your home. You may be assigned to sea or shore squadrons on almost any continent. You will have the opportunity to work in a variety of environments—airborne aircraft, hangars, flight decks, flight lines at air stations and on aircraft carriers.\n\nPART-TIME OPPORTUNITIES\n\nSome of the above aviation jobs in the Navy Reserve are open only to prior or current military aviators",
